"""
GOAL:
Take two sentences (c^n, s^n) and produce a reasonable summarization c^n+1, to be used in a recursive implementation

CURRENT WORK:
Try out using the previously used graph-based method to see if it works (at all) given we're only using two sentences
If not, then try POS tagging and synsets to match words together

ERRORS:
"meets" isn't counted as a verb?????
