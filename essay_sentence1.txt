Sentence compression is a standard NLP task where the goal is to generate a shorter paraphrase of a sentence.

Automatic sentence compression can be broadly described as the task of creating a grammatical summary of a single sentence with minimal information loss.

Summarization in general, and sentence compression in particular, are popular topics.

The ability to compress sentences grammatically with minimal information loss is an important problem in text summarization.

Most of the research in automatic summarization has focused on extraction, i.e., on identifying the most important clauses/sentences/paragraphs in texts.
